#### To run the app from the console, paste this into the console: 
#install.packages("shiny")
#library(shiny)
#runApp("shinyapp")

# uncomment the below to run locally in RStudio on Sophia's computer and not in console as above
# if un locally on another computer, the working directory should be inside the "shinyapp" folder
#setwd("~/Spatial analytics/project - queer travel map/lgbt-travel-map/shinyapp")


#### LOAD PACKAGES AND DATA ####

library(shiny)
library(sf)
library(leaflet)
library(leaflet.extras)
library(tidyverse)
library(stringr)
library(lwgeom)

# load in data
EEA_data <- st_read("../data/EEA_points.shp") 
#### NB: for sending the script to shinyapps.io (for getting a link to the app),
#### you have to put the data-folder into the shinyapp-folder and delete the "../" from the path

# plot the points (don't know why it only shows 6)
#plot(st_geometry(EEA_data))

# look at the coordinates
#EEA_data["geometry"]

# check the crs
#st_crs(EEA_data)

# when looking at the initial map (by running a leaflet map with the data) 
#the points were not at the right place - maybe 100 meters to the north east. I also got this error message:
#sf layer has inconsistent datum (+proj=longlat +ellps=intl +towgs84=-86,-98,-119,0,0,0,0 +no_defs).
#Need '+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84' 

# I can also read here https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/projections.html that WGS84 is the default projection of Leaflet 
# -> therefore, I re-project the data to this crs and it works!
crs_needed <- "+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84"
safespace_EEA_crs <- st_transform(EEA_data, crs = crs_needed)




#### PREPARING SAFE SPACE HULLS/GAYBORHOODS ####

gayborhoods <- st_read("../data/gayborhoods1km.shp") # load in data
#### NB: for sending the script to shinyapps.io (for getting a link to the app),
#### you have to put the data-folder into the shinyapp-folder and delete the "../" from the path

gayborhoods <- st_transform(gayborhoods, crs = crs_needed) # transform to the needed crs





#### UI ####

# prepare the user interface
ui <- fluidPage(
  titlePanel("LGBTQ+ Travel Map"), # map title
  titlePanel(h5("Creators: Rebecca Folmer Schade and Sophia Kleist Karlson")), # map subtitle
  leafletOutput("map"), # the output should be a leaflet map
  column( # add a column below the map to explain the map

    h5("Wellcome to our LGBTQ+ Travel Map! On this map, you can see LGBTQ+ safe spaces all over Europe.
       The safe spaces and gayborhoods are hiding within the colored bubbles, so click on a bubble to zoom in on the area you want to check out!
       The safe spaces are marked with purple circles, and gayborhoods with purple polygons. Click on a safe space or gayborhood to see information about it. 
       If you click the crosshair button on the left, you will see your own location (red marker) and your nearest safe space (purple marker).
       If you click the measurement button on the left, you can plan a route and see its length.
       Finally, in the top right corner, you can choose if you want to see a topographic or aerial map. Here, you can also choose to see only safe spaces, or only gayborhoods.
       WARNING: The gayborhoods highlight clusters of safe spaces, but they do not guarantee that the area between those safe spaces will be safe!
       This map is part of an exam project for the course Spatial Analytics at Aarhus University, Denmark.")
